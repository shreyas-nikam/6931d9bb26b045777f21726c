# QuLab: Comprehensive ML Model Risk Auditing for Financial Institutions
Duration: 0:45:00

## Introduction to ML Model Risk Auditing with QuLab
Duration: 0:05:00

Welcome to **QuLab**, an interactive Streamlit application designed for **Risk Managers** in financial institutions to conduct a thorough data provenance and risk audit of Machine Learning (ML) loan underwriting models.

In today's data-driven financial landscape, ML models are increasingly used for critical decisions like loan approvals. While these models offer efficiency, they also introduce significant risks:
*   **Bias**: Models can unintentionally learn and perpetuate biases present in historical data, leading to unfair or discriminatory outcomes.
*   **Lack of Transparency**: Complex ML models can be "black boxes," making it difficult to understand how decisions are made, which is a major concern for regulatory bodies.
*   **Compliance Risk**: Automated decisions must adhere to strict regulatory standards (e.g., Fair Lending Act, GDPR), requiring robust auditing and documentation.
*   **Operational Risk**: Flaws in data, model design, or deployment can lead to incorrect decisions, financial losses, and reputational damage.

This codelab will guide you through the **QuLab** application, demonstrating an end-to-end narrative for auditing an ML loan underwriting model. You will learn to:

1.  **Ingest and Understand Data**: Start with raw data, perform initial checks.
2.  **Manage Data Provenance**: Document data lineage and transformations.
3.  **Audit Data Quality**: Identify and quantify missing values and outliers.
4.  **Perform Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**: Apply strategies to rectify data issues.
5.  **Detect and Analyze Bias**: Uncover demographic disparities in outcomes or data distributions.
6.  **Simulate Risk and Implement Human Oversight**: Evaluate model robustness under uncertainty and define human intervention points.
7.  **Establish Risk Register & Governance**: Document identified risks and mitigation plans.
8.  **Generate an Audit Report**: Compile findings into a comprehensive report for stakeholders.

By the end of this codelab, you will have a clear understanding of the functionalities required to build a robust assurance case for ML models, evidencing trustworthiness, compliance, and fairness, thereby mitigating model risk for your institution.

### Application Architecture Overview

The QuLab application is built using Streamlit, a Python library for creating interactive web applications. The core `app.py` file acts as a central orchestrator, managing the navigation between different audit stages and maintaining a consistent `st.session_state` across these stages.

Each audit stage is encapsulated in a separate Python file within the `application_pages` directory (e.g., `page_1_data_ingestion.py`, `page_2_data_provenance.py`). The `app.py` uses a sidebar `st.selectbox` for navigation. When a user selects a page, `app.py` imports and executes the `main()` function of the corresponding page script.

<aside class="positive">
The use of `st.session_state` is crucial in this application. It allows data (like `raw_data`, `cleaned_data`, `provenance_logs`, `risk_register`) to persist and be shared across different pages and user interactions, simulating a continuous audit workflow. Without `st.session_state`, Streamlit applications reset their state on every rerun.
</aside>

```python
# app.py snippet for navigation
import streamlit as st
# ... other imports

# Initialize session state for data if not already present
if "raw_data" not in st.session_state:
    st.session_state.raw_data = None
# ... other session state initializations

page = st.sidebar.selectbox(
    label="Navigation",
    options=[
        "1. Data Ingestion & Overview",
        # ... other pages
    ]
)

if page == "1. Data Ingestion & Overview":
    from application_pages.page_1_data_ingestion import main
    main()
# ... other page logic
```

This modular design makes the application easy to develop, maintain, and extend, allowing each audit step to be developed and tested independently while contributing to a unified user experience.

## 1. Data Ingestion & Overview
Duration: 0:05:00

### Step 1: Data Ingestion & Overview
As a Risk Manager, your first task is to get a foundational understanding of the raw loan application data. This involves reviewing its structure, content, and initial statistics to identify any immediate anomalies or areas that might require closer scrutiny during the audit process.

**How this helps:** This initial data review is crucial for establishing the baseline for your audit. By understanding the raw state of the data, you can better track transformations, identify data quality issues, and ultimately build a robust case for model trustworthiness.

**Underlying concept:** Data ingestion and initial exploration are fundamental steps in any data-driven workflow, providing the necessary context for subsequent analysis and model development. It ensures that the data being used is understood and relevant to the business problem.

The application starts by generating a synthetic dataset of loan applications if no data is present in `st.session_state.raw_data`. This ensures that the application is immediately usable for demonstration purposes.

```python
# application_pages/page_1_data_ingestion.py snippet
if st.session_state.raw_data is None:
    num_records = 1000
    data = {
        "Loan_ID": [f"L{i:04d}" for i in range(num_records)],
        "Gender": np.random.choice(["Male", "Female"], num_records, p=[0.6, 0.4]),
        # ... other data generation
    }
    df = pd.DataFrame(data)
    # Introduce some missing values intentionally for demonstration
    for col in ["Gender", "Married", "Dependents", "Self_Employed", "LoanAmount", "Credit_History"]:
        missing_indices = np.random.choice(df.index, int(num_records * 0.05), replace=False)
        df.loc[missing_indices, col] = np.nan
    st.session_state.raw_data = df.copy()
```

The page then displays:

*   **Raw Loan Application Data Sample**: The first few rows of the generated or ingested data.
*   **Dataset Summary Statistics**: Descriptive statistics for all columns, giving an overview of numerical distributions and categorical counts.
*   **Missing Values Overview**: A table showing the count and percentage of missing values for each column. This immediately highlights potential data quality issues.

<aside class="positive">
<b>Risk Manager's Action:</b> You have now reviewed the initial state of the data. Notice the presence of missing values and various data types. This preliminary check helps you anticipate the next steps in data preparation and identify potential data quality risks.
</aside>

A button "Proceed to Data Provenance & Metadata Management" allows you to move to the next step, updating `st.session_state.current_page` and triggering a rerun to load the next page.

## 2. Data Provenance & Metadata Management
Duration: 0:04:00

### Step 2: Data Provenance & Metadata Management
As a Risk Manager, it's critical to understand where your data comes from, how it's been transformed, and who has accessed or modified it. This step involves documenting the data's lineage and managing its metadata, which are essential for auditability and compliance.

**How this helps:** A clear provenance trail helps in tracing back any anomalies or errors to their source, ensuring data integrity and providing a strong evidentiary basis for regulatory audits. Robust metadata management enhances data understanding and reusability.

**Underlying concept:** Data provenance is the record of the origins and history of a piece of data. Metadata management involves creating and maintaining descriptive information about the data. Together, they form the foundation for data governance and trust in analytical results.

This page displays:

*   **Existing Metadata**: (Conceptual in this app, could be extended to show data dictionary).
*   **Provenance Logs**: A DataFrame (`st.session_state.provenance_logs`) that records actions taken on the data, including timestamps, actions, descriptions, and users.

You can add new entries to the provenance log:

```python
# application_pages/page_2_data_provenance.py snippet
action_description = st.text_area("Describe the data action or lineage event (e.g., "Initial data load from core banking system", "Schema validation performed"):")
user_name = st.text_input("Your Name/User ID:", value="Risk_Manager_001")

if st.button("Add to Provenance Log"):
    if action_description:
        new_log_entry = {
            "Timestamp": datetime.datetime.now().strftime("%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S"),
            "Action": "Data Lineage Documentation",
            "Description": action_description,
            "User": user_name
        }
        st.session_state.provenance_logs = pd.concat(
            [st.session_state.provenance_logs, pd.DataFrame([new_log_entry])],
            ignore_index=True
        )
        st.success("Provenance log updated successfully!")
        st.dataframe(st.session_state.provenance_logs)
```

<aside class="positive">
<b>Risk Manager's Insight:</b> By maintaining meticulous logs, you are building an undeniable record of data handling, which is paramount for justifying model decisions and meeting regulatory requirements.
</aside>

A button "Proceed to Data Quality Audits" allows you to move to the next step.

## 3. Data Quality Audits
Duration: 0:06:00

### Step 3: Data Quality Audits
As a Risk Manager, after understanding the data's origin, your next step is to rigorously audit its quality. This means identifying and quantifying issues like missing values and outliers, which can significantly skew model performance and lead to unfair or inaccurate predictions. This step ensures the data's reliability before it's used for any modeling.

**How this helps:** Identifying data quality issues early prevents the propagation of errors into the model. By understanding where data is incomplete or abnormal, you can make informed decisions about cleaning strategies, ultimately leading to a more robust and trustworthy model that adheres to risk guidelines.

**Underlying concept:** Data quality auditing involves assessing the accuracy, completeness, consistency, and timeliness of data. Missing value analysis helps identify gaps, while outlier detection uncovers unusual data points that might represent errors or rare, but significant, events.

This page provides visualizations for:

*   **Missing Values Analysis**: A bar plot showing the percentage of missing values for each feature. This gives a quick visual indication of which columns have the most data gaps.

    ```python
    # application_pages/page_3_data_quality_audits.py snippet
    fig_missing, ax_missing = plt.subplots(figsize=(10, 6))
    sns.barplot(x=missing_data.index, y="Missing Percentage", data=missing_data, ax=ax_missing, palette="viridis")
    ax_missing.set_title("Percentage of Missing Values Per Feature")
    st.pyplot(fig_missing)
    ```

    <aside class="negative">
    A common threshold for concern is often around $5-10\%$ missing data for a single feature. If a feature exceeds this, its utility and reliability might be compromised, influencing model accuracy and fairness. For example, if a feature like Credit_History is $10\%$ missing, it means $10\%$ of our loan applicants lack this crucial information, potentially leading to biased loan decisions if not handled properly.
    </aside>

*   **Outlier Detection (Numerical Features)**: Box plots are generated for each numerical feature, allowing visual identification of outliers.

    ```python
    # application_pages/page_3_data_quality_audits.py snippet
    for col in numerical_cols:
        fig_outlier, ax_outlier = plt.subplots(figsize=(8, 4))
        sns.boxplot(x=df[col], ax=ax_outlier, palette="rocket")
        ax_outlier.set_title(f"Box Plot of {col}")
        st.pyplot(fig_outlier)
    ```

    Mathematically, outliers are often defined as values that fall below $Q1 - 1.5 \times IQR$ or above $Q3 + 1.5 \times IQR$, where $Q1$ is the first quartile, $Q3$ is the third quartile, and $IQR$ is the Interquartile Range ($Q3 - Q1$).

<aside class="positive">
<b>Risk Manager's Insight:</b> You've now identified critical data quality issues: missing values and outliers. These findings directly inform the necessity of data cleaning and preprocessing steps to ensure the data is fit for model consumption and that model risk is minimized.
</aside>

A button "Proceed to Data Cleaning and Preprocessing" allows you to move to the next step. If raw data is not loaded, it prompts to go back to "Data Ingestion & Overview".

## 4. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
Duration: 0:08:00

### Step 4: Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
As a Risk Manager, after identifying data quality issues, your next crucial task is to clean and preprocess the data. This involves making strategic decisions about handling missing values and outliers to ensure the data is suitable for model training. These decisions directly impact the model's fairness, accuracy, and compliance.

**How this helps:** By thoughtfully cleaning the data, you remove noise and inconsistencies that could lead to biased outcomes or poor model performance. This step is vital for building a reliable and defensible machine learning model, thereby mitigating significant model risk.

**Underlying concept:** Data cleaning transforms raw data into a usable format, often involving imputation for missing values and methods to address outliers. Preprocessing techniques standardize or normalize data, preparing it for algorithms, ensuring that the model learns from high-quality, representative data.

This page provides interactive controls for:

*   **Missing Value Imputation**: For each column with missing values, you can select an imputation strategy: "Median", "Mean" (for numerical), "Mode" (for categorical), or "Remove Rows".

    ```python
    # application_pages/page_4_data_cleaning.py snippet
    for col in missing_cols:
        col_type = df[col].dtype
        if pd.api.types.is_numeric_dtype(col_type):
            options = ["Median", "Mean", "Remove Rows"]
            default_index = options.index("Median")
        else:
            options = ["Mode", "Remove Rows"]
            default_index = options.index("Mode")
        strategy = st.selectbox(f"Select imputation strategy for **`{col}`**:", options=options, index=default_index, key=f"impute_{col}")
        imputation_strategies[col] = strategy
    ```

    For numerical features like `LoanAmount`, replacing missing values with the **median** avoids skewing the distribution with extreme values that a mean might introduce. If the data for `ApplicantIncome` is missing, using the median ensures that the imputed values are typical for the dataset. For categorical features such as `Gender` or `Married`, using the **mode** (most frequent category) is a common strategy to maintain the overall distribution of categories. Removing rows with missing values can lead to data loss and potential sampling bias if missingness is not random.

*   **Outlier Handling (Numerical Features)**: You can choose to "None", "Cap Outliers (IQR Method)", or "Remove Outliers (IQR Method)" for numerical features, along with an adjustable IQR multiplier.

    ```python
    # application_pages/page_4_data_cleaning.py snippet
    outlier_handling_strategy = st.selectbox(
        "Select outlier handling strategy:",
        options=["None", "Cap Outliers (IQR Method)", "Remove Outliers (IQR Method)"],
        index=1, # Default to capping
        key="outlier_strategy"
    )
    # ... slider for iqr_multiplier
    ```

    The Interquartile Range (IQR) method defines outliers as values falling outside $[Q1 - k \times IQR, Q3 + k \times IQR]$, where $Q1$ is the first quartile, $Q3$ is the third quartile, $IQR = Q3 - Q1$, and $k$ is the multiplier (typically $1.5$ for mild outliers, $3.0$ for extreme outliers). A lower multiplier (e.g., $1.5$) will identify more points as outliers, potentially cleaning more aggressively, while a higher multiplier (e.g., $3.0$) will be more conservative.

After applying the cleaning, the `st.session_state.cleaned_data` is updated, and the page shows:

*   **Cleaned Data Sample**: The first few rows of the processed data.
*   **Comparison: Missing Values Before vs. After Cleaning**: A table showing the impact of imputation on missing counts.
*   **Comparison: Descriptive Statistics (Numerical Features)**: Side-by-side descriptive statistics for raw and cleaned numerical features, demonstrating the effect of outlier handling.

<aside class="positive">
<b>Risk Manager's Insight:</b> You've successfully applied data cleaning strategies, addressing missing values and outliers. This refined dataset is now more robust and less prone to introducing biases or errors into the model. These steps are crucial for maintaining the integrity of the model audit trail.
</aside>

All cleaning actions are also logged in `st.session_state.provenance_logs`. A button "Proceed to Bias Detection & Analysis" allows you to move to the next step.

## 5. Bias Detection & Analysis
Duration: 0:07:00

### Step 5: Bias Detection & Analysis
As a Risk Manager, a critical aspect of auditing ML models is to detect and analyze potential biases in the data. Biases can lead to unfair outcomes for certain demographic groups (e.g., based on gender, education, or other protected characteristics), leading to ethical and regulatory concerns. This step helps quantify these disparities.

**How this helps:** Identifying data bias early allows for intervention strategies, such as re-sampling, re-weighting, or incorporating fairness constraints into model training. This ensures that the model operates equitably and complies with non-discrimination regulations, significantly reducing reputational and legal risks.

**Underlying concept:** **Bias detection** in ML focuses on identifying systematic and unfair discrimination against certain groups. **Demographic parity** is a fairness metric that requires the probability of a positive outcome (e.g., loan approval) to be the same across different demographic groups. If $P(\text{outcome}=Y | \text{group}=A) \approx P(\text{outcome}=Y | \text{group}=B)$, then demographic parity is satisfied. **Distributional analysis** compares feature distributions across groups to identify underlying disparities that might lead to bias.

This page allows you to:

*   **Select Sensitive Attribute for Bias Analysis**: Choose a categorical feature like "Gender" or "Education" as a protected attribute.

*   **Loan Approval Rates by Sensitive Attribute (Demographic Parity)**: The application calculates and displays the approval rate for each group within the selected sensitive attribute, along with the **Demographic Parity Difference**. A bar chart visually compares these rates.

    ```python
    # application_pages/page_5_bias_detection.py snippet (reconstructed)
    # ... selection of sensitive_attr
    bias_metrics_result = calculate_demographic_parity(df_cleaned, selected_sensitive_attr, target_column, positive_outcome)
    if bias_metrics_result:
        st.dataframe(pd.DataFrame({"Approval Rate": bias_metrics_result["Approval Rates"]}).T)
        st.metric(
            label=f"Demographic Parity Difference (max_rate - min_rate) for '{selected_sensitive_attr}'",
            value=f"{bias_metrics_result['Demographic Parity Difference']:.4f}"
        )
        fig_parity, ax_parity = plt.subplots(figsize=(10, 6))
        sns.barplot(x=list(approval_rates.keys()), y=list(approval_rates.values()), ax=ax_parity, palette="pastel")
        st.pyplot(fig_parity)
    ```

    **Demographic parity** is achieved when the proportion of positive outcomes (e.g., loan approvals) is roughly equal across different groups of a sensitive attribute. The **Demographic Parity Difference** quantifies this:
    $$ DPD = \max_{g \in G} P(\text{Outcome}=Y| \text{Group}=g) - \min_{g \in G} P(\text{Outcome}=Y| \text{Group}=g) $$
    A DPD close to zero indicates better demographic parity. A large difference (e.g., greater than $0.1$) suggests a significant disparity that might indicate bias.

*   **Conditional Distribution of Key Numerical Features**: Box plots are used to visualize the distribution of a selected numerical feature (e.g., `ApplicantIncome`, `LoanAmount`) across the different groups of the sensitive attribute. This helps in identifying if underlying disparities in the input data contribute to potential bias.

    ```python
    # application_pages/page_5_bias_detection.py snippet (reconstructed)
    # ... selection of numerical_feature
    fig_dist, ax_dist = plt.subplots(figsize=(10, 6))
    sns.boxplot(x=selected_sensitive_attr, y=selected_numerical_feature, data=df_cleaned, ax=ax_dist, palette="light:b", dodge=False)
    ax_dist.set_title(f"Distribution of {selected_numerical_feature} by {selected_sensitive_attr}")
    st.pyplot(fig_dist)
    ```
    If, for instance, the median `ApplicantIncome` for 'Female' applicants is consistently lower and less spread out than for 'Male' applicants, it suggests an income disparity that the model might exploit, even if unintentionally. This disparity could lead to a biased prediction if not properly addressed.

<aside class="positive">
<b>Risk Manager's Insight:</b> You have now completed a critical assessment of potential biases in the loan application data. The identified disparities in approval rates or feature distributions highlight areas where the model might exhibit unfair behavior. These insights are crucial for developing mitigation strategies and ensuring responsible AI deployment.
</aside>

The calculated bias metrics are stored in `st.session_state.bias_metrics`. A button "Proceed to Risk Simulation & Human Oversight" allows you to move to the next step.

## 6. Risk Simulation & Human Oversight
Duration: 0:07:00

### Step 6: Risk Simulation & Human Oversight
As a Risk Manager, you need to assess how robust the model's decisions are under various conditions, especially when there's uncertainty in the input data. This involves simulating potential data fluctuations or errors and observing their impact on loan underwriting outcomes. Crucially, you'll define criteria for flagging cases that require human review, ensuring critical decisions benefit from expert judgment.

**How this helps:** Risk simulation helps identify scenarios where the model might be vulnerable or make unreliable predictions. By setting up clear human oversight thresholds, you establish a safety net, ensuring that high-stakes decisions are not solely automated and adhere to the institution's risk appetite and ethical guidelines. This proactive approach prevents erroneous decisions and reinforces responsible AI deployment.

**Underlying concept:** Risk simulation uses techniques like Monte Carlo methods (though simplified here) to model the impact of input variable uncertainty on model outputs. Human oversight integrates expert judgment into automated workflows, typically by setting thresholds (e.g., a "probability of default" score) that trigger manual review for cases falling into critical or ambiguous zones. This balances automation efficiency with human accountability.

This page allows you to configure and run a risk simulation:

*   **Configure Simulation Parameters**: Use sliders to introduce hypothetical uncertainty into `ApplicantIncome` and `LoanAmount` (e.g., `+/- 5%`), and a "Credit History Data Noise" level (probability of falsification/error).

    ```python
    # application_pages/page_6_risk_simulation.py snippet
    income_uncertainty_percent = st.slider("Applicant Income Uncertainty (+/- %):", min_value=0, max_value=20, value=5, step=1)
    loan_amount_uncertainty_percent = st.slider("Loan Amount Uncertainty (+/- %):", min_value=0, max_value=20, value=5, step=1)
    credit_history_noise_level = st.slider("Credit History Data Noise (Probability of Falsification/Error):", min_value=0.0, max_value=0.1, value=0.01, step=0.005)
    ```

*   **Human Oversight Thresholds**: Set a "Probability of Default Threshold for Human Review". Loans with a simulated risk score above this threshold will be flagged.

    ```python
    # application_pages/page_6_risk_simulation.py snippet
    human_review_threshold = st.slider(
        "Probability of Default Threshold for Human Review:",
        min_value=0.0, max_value=1.0, value=0.6, step=0.05
    )
    ```
    The **Probability of Default (PD)** threshold for human review, denoted as $T_{HR}$, is a critical governance parameter. If a loan application's simulated risk score (PD) exceeds this threshold, i.e., $PD_{simulated} > T_{HR}$, it automatically triggers a manual review by a human expert. This ensures that high-risk cases, or those with uncertain outcomes, are subjected to closer scrutiny, mitigating potential financial losses and reputational damage. For instance, if $T_{HR} = 0.6$, any loan with a $PD_{simulated}$ greater than $0.6$ is flagged.

When "Run Risk Simulation" is clicked, the application:

1.  Applies the configured uncertainties to the `cleaned_data`.
2.  Generates a `Simulated_Risk_Score` (mock probability of default) using a simplified logic.
3.  Determines a `Mock_Loan_Status_Predicted`.
4.  Flags applications for human review if their `Simulated_Risk_Score` exceeds the `human_review_threshold`.
5.  Stores these results in `st.session_state.simulated_results` and updates the provenance logs.

The results are then displayed, showing:

*   **Simulation Results Overview**: Counts and a bar chart of applications flagged for human review.
*   **Sample of Applications Flagged for Human Review**: A table showing details of the top 10 flagged applications, allowing a Risk Manager to inspect high-risk cases.

<aside class="positive">
<b>Risk Manager's Action:</b> You have successfully simulated risk and identified cases requiring human oversight. This process validates the model's behavior under stress and reinforces the importance of human-in-the-loop decision-making for high-risk scenarios. This forms a crucial part of your assurance case.

## 7. Risk Register & Governance
Duration: 0:06:00

### Step 7: Risk Register & Governance
As a Risk Manager, after identifying potential biases and simulating various risk scenarios, it's crucial to formally document these risks, assess their severity, and propose concrete mitigation strategies. This step involves updating the institutional **Risk Register**, a central repository for tracking and managing all identified risks related to the ML model. This ensures a transparent and accountable governance framework.

**How this helps:** A well-maintained risk register provides a comprehensive overview of all model-related risks, their potential impact, and the planned actions to control them. This systematic approach allows for proactive risk management, facilitates compliance reporting, and informs strategic decisions to enhance model trustworthiness and reduce overall organizational exposure.

**Underlying concept:** A risk register is a key tool in enterprise risk management, providing a structured way to identify, analyze, and monitor risks. Governance refers to the framework of rules, practices, and processes by which an organization is directed and controlled. For ML models, this includes establishing clear responsibilities, audit trails, and decision-making protocols to ensure ethical and compliant AI deployment.

This page displays:

*   **Current Model Risk Register**: A DataFrame (`st.session_state.risk_register`) showing all documented risks.
*   **Add New Risk Entry** form: A form to input details about a new risk.

    ```python
    # application_pages/page_7_risk_register.py snippet
    with st.form("new_risk_form"):
        risk_id = st.text_input("Risk ID:", value=f"MR_{len(st.session_state.risk_register) + 1:03d}")
        risk_name = st.text_input("Risk Name (e.g., 'Gender Bias in Loan Approval'):")
        category = st.selectbox("Category:", options=["Data Quality", "Bias", "Model Performance", "Compliance", "Operational"])
        description = st.text_area("Description of the Risk:")
        likelihood = st.selectbox("Likelihood:", options=["Low", "Medium", "High"])
        impact = st.selectbox("Impact:", options=["Low", "Medium", "High"])
        mitigation_strategy = st.text_area("Proposed Mitigation Strategy:")
        status = st.selectbox("Status:", options=["Open", "In Progress", "Closed"])
        owner = st.text_input("Owner (e.g., 'Head of Model Risk'):", value="Risk_Manager_001")

        submitted = st.form_submit_button("Add Risk to Register")
        if submitted:
            # ... calculates risk_score = likelihood_map[likelihood] * impact_map[impact]
            # ... adds new_risk_entry to st.session_state.risk_register
            # ... updates provenance logs
    ```

    The risk score is calculated using a simple multiplication of numerical values mapped from "Low", "Medium", "High" likelihood and impact (e.g., Low=1, Medium=2, High=3). This provides a quantitative measure for prioritizing risks.

<aside class="positive">
<b>Risk Manager's Insight:</b> By maintaining a detailed risk register, you're not just identifying problems; you're actively contributing to the institution's robust model governance framework. This documentation is crucial for internal reviews and external regulatory compliance, demonstrating a proactive approach to managing AI-related risks.

A button "Proceed to Audit Report & Insights" allows you to move to the final step.

## 8. Audit Report & Insights
Duration: 0:07:00

### Step 8: Audit Report & Insights
As a Risk Manager, you've meticulously worked through the data provenance, quality, bias detection, and risk simulation stages. Now, your final task is to compile all these findings into a comprehensive audit report. This report serves as a definitive assurance case, documenting the model's trustworthiness, compliance, and fairness for both internal stakeholders and regulatory bodies.

**How this helps:** The audit report is the culmination of your entire risk management process. It provides a clear, defensible summary of the model's adherence to standards, the risks identified, and the mitigation strategies proposed. This document is crucial for regulatory compliance, internal governance, and fostering trust in the automated decision-making system.

**Underlying concept:** An audit report formally communicates the results of an audit, including findings, conclusions, and recommendations. In the context of ML model risk, it synthesizes technical analyses into a business-relevant narrative, providing transparency and accountability for the model's lifecycle management.

<b>Risk Manager's Final Reflection:</b> You have successfully completed a full audit cycle for the ML loan underwriting model. The generated report is your testament to ensuring responsible AI. This rigorous process not only highlights areas for improvement but also provides the necessary evidence for regulatory compliance and stakeholder confidence.
</aside>

### Next Steps for Governance:
*   **Regular Review:** Schedule periodic audits to reassess data quality, model performance, and bias metrics.
*   **Mitigation Tracking:** Continuously monitor the status of risks in the Risk Register and the effectiveness of implemented mitigation strategies.
*   **Policy Updates:** Propose updates to internal policies and procedures based on audit findings to strengthen model governance.
